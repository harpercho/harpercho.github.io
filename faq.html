<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>DISCLAIMER: These are only questions that I <i>anticipate</i> will be frequently asked. No one has actually asked me any questions.</p>
<pre>
    <em>Why does your website look like this?</em>
    Because I have no website building experience and this is written in basic html.
    <em>Will you make a better/more professional looking website?</em>
    Maybe but not soon.
