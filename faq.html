<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>DISCLAIMER: These are only questions that I <i>anticipate</i> will be frequently asked. No one has actually asked me any questions.</p>

    Maybe but not soon.

<p><b>What do you do?</b></p>
Physics/neuroscience research mainly.

<p><b>What is your favorite video game genre?</b></p>
I like all kinds of video games but I think indie horror games really capture the full extent of what video games are capable of as an artistic experience.
Player agency takes center stage as fear and anxiety are entirely dependent on your own personal actions in the game. Immersion becomes a part of the narrative process in such a visceral way that the genre really shines a light on how video games can not only tell compelling stories but can tell ultimately <i>unique</i> stories.
